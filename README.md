# LAN-Controlled-TENS-UNIT

This is a project I made just for fun to play around with the relays I got, which I used for the buttons. This is a simple HTTP server running off of a raspberry pi and you can access it from your local network and you will be brought to a simple HTML website with a link you can click to turn it off or on.
